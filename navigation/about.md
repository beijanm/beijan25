## Interests and Skills
- **Football**: The actual game is not the only reason that I love football but it is the brotherhood that is formed through hard work in practice and games where you don't know if you will make it to the buzzer. This is what makes me love playing the game.
- **Computer Science**: Although I have a very basic understanding of programming and computer science, I really enjoy learning about it. I especially like when I am in a rut and not able to figure out what to do. This is because I learn how to solve the problem and I probobly wont forget it and the problem wont occur again. Even with headaches and stress computer science is a big interest of mine.
- **Reading**: After a long day of stress and work reading helps me relax and forget about a lot of my problems for the times being.
- **Finance**: I am in the DECA club in with I learn about topics in finance and I go to competitions to test my knowledge against other competetors.

## Projects
### 1. Clash Royale API
**Description**: This project was my very first in Computer Science Principles so I remember it well. This project introduces to to backends and frontends and everything in between and sparked my interest for computer science. I also learned a very important skill, teamwork. I realized that without teamwork, you are not able to finish the project. The basics for this project were a JSON file holding all the data and fetching the data in the frontend to a pretty basic project.
