            <strong>Grade I Think I Deserve:</strong><br>
            The grade I think that I deserve for the trimester taking everything into account is a .8
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What I Did Good to Deserve the Grade:</strong><br>
            I made some integral feature to the seed tracker that would not allow it to work with. I was consistent with the team teaches, doing good on homework and doing my part in the presentation. Even though it doesn't seem like I had a successful trimester I tries my best to put in effort when necessary and I hope to fix my weaknesses going into the third trimester.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What I Did Bad to Deserve the Grade:</strong><br>
            When I didnt know what to do I would slack off and not get any work done when I should have been looking for more work to do. Communication was definitely my downfall this trimester as if I had communicated better I would have made more impactful features due to knowing what was needed.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What I Want to Do in the Future to Get a Better Grade:</strong><br>
            My plan for the next trimester sounds rather simple but takes a bit of effort to execute. I plan to communicate a lot more to scrum masters for what my part of the project should be and work to do both in person and in slack. This will allow me to get more work done. I will also try not to slack off during class. I show up on time everyday and I want to keep that up as I think punctuality is very important. This is how I aim to acheive a .9 next trimester
