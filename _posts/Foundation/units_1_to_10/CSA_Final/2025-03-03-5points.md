            <strong>Some of my Issues:</strong><br>

            <strong>Burn Down Tri 2:</strong><br>
            Multiple Fields Updated: You can now update grade, comment, and name in one PUT request.<br>
            Null Protection: The code only updates a field if the new value is not null.<br>
            Grade Logging: It prints both the old and new grade for easy debugging.<br>
            Immediate Return: The updated Seed is returned right away so the frontend sees new data immediately.<br>
            Same CRUD Flow: The existing GET, POST, and DELETE methods remain unchanged and easy to use.
        </p>

            <strong>Burn Down for Tri 3:</strong><br>
            Front end for seed tracker is currently fine. MAKE SURE IT LINKS TO the profile of the student, not just the name you enter.<br>
            Students should also be able to view their current seed and any changes that the teacher has made.<br>
            In the backend, the teacher should see the current seed grade, the new seed request, and any new changes to the seed with additional comments.<br>
            The seed should be an ongoing grade you can change and update.<br>
            MAKE SURE there is a log of the changes in the seed that is visible to the teacher.
