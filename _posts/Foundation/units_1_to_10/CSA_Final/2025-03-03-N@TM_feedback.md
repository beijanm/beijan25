  <h1>Hacks for Unit 2</h1>

  <p>
    What I learned from the quiz:
    What I learned from this quiz is that I am not as proficient in boolean expressions and if statements as I previously thought and I worked on improving my knowledge on it.
    My wrong answers with:
    <img width="1105" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-19 at 8 48 07 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37446da8-9ea8-4d6b-8670-0f7e72c47c74">
    - The correct answer is (C) Value is: 2 because integer division is used (x / y), and since both x and y are integers, the decimal part is truncated, resulting in 7 / 3 = 2.
    <img width="1099" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-19 at 8 48 27 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf6c0797-3407-4f97-8e9c-ce3c9537d911">
    - The correct answer is (C) because the method iterates in reverse and moves elements starting with "b" to the front of the list while maintaining their relative order, resulting in the transformation observed in the given list.
    <img width="1097" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-19 at 9 12 41 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7852d4e7-dde5-45d3-ba39-ac9550930f0f">
    - The correct answer is (B) 7, 9, 11 because it tests all three conditions: odd numbers (x % 2 != 0), numbers greater than 9 (x > 9), and numbers not greater than 9 or even (else condition).
